# Digital Euro Association (DEA) MiCAR Tracker

This project tracks issuers of Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) under the MiCAR framework. The dashboard is a simple static site that reads data from a public Google Sheets document and visualises it using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Data source

`update-data.js` downloads a CSV export of the ESMA registers from Google Sheets, ensuring the dashboard reflects the latest EMT and CASP information published by the regulator.

The script parses the CSV, converts each row into a JavaScript object and then rewrites `index.html` with the new data and a humanâ€‘friendly source date.

## Configuration

The script reads CSV locations from the `CSV_URL` and `DATE_URL` environment variables. If they are not set, default URLs pointing to the public Google Sheet are used.
